*- interrupt handler for keys
- look into the minimization to see if minimization affects end target
*- lsh for nns
*- work on moving both ends 
*- linearization on 2 ends
*- histogram of running times for a given sample

- account for surgical instruments 
-RC planning to account for collisions 

future:
needle steering, dubin's car
smoothing paths



4/1
* test running times on # of links
  see how dist fn affects running times

distance metric ideas:
-put a cost on each point
-lqr 

4/4

- restart, see if the same samples make the old tree better
- fix hyperplanes or use exact nns
- see if histogram stuff has been done before
- see if you can maintain shape

- todo: change rest_length
- rc planner infinite dim

--kavraki open motion planning toolkit



-approximate min links for thread
-with min links, seed the higher dimension one
  - run rrt see if you can get htere
  - run local planner to see if we can stay on the path nicely 
- have a procedure to verify that the min link model is decent approx for the real thread
- constrain planning by the procedure

4/5 
  need to extend sampling to move both ends
