- interrupt handler for keys
- look into the minimization to see if minimization affects end target
- lsh for nns
- work on moving both ends 
- linearization on 2 ends
- histogram of running times for a given sample

future things: 
- account for surgical instruments 
  -RC planning to account for collisions 
-incrementally add links


needle steering, dubin's car
smoothing paths



4/1
test running times on # of links
see how dist fn affects running times

distance metric ideas:
-put a cost on each point
-lqr
