Experimental Plan

Linearization refers to solving for control u given start x_s and goal x_g by
x_s - x_g = Bu. 

Interpolation refers to generating a trajectory x_1,x_2,..,x_T-1 given x_s and x_s by x_t = (T-t)/T * x_s + (t/T) * x_g. 

1) Linearization to Goal
Notes: Gets stuck in local energy minimum for long trajectories. 

2) Interpolation + Linearization
Notes: Not really any better than straight linearization. The interpolation acts as waypoints for the linearization, but generally there is no improvement as the algorithm gets stuck in local energy minimum. 

3) SQP - Directly apply controls 
Notes: Do not get as far as we think we do if we simply reapply the controls from SQP. 

4) SQP + Linearization
